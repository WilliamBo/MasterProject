Classification on functional fragments following the algorithm described in "Recovering Covariance from Functional Fragments" by Marie-Hélène Descary and Victor M. Panaretos.

All functions are written in functions.py. Examples following Scenario A and B in the paper are in the notebook *CovarianceFragments.ipynb*.

An example of the use of covariance recovery in a classification task is presented in the notebook *Classification.ipynb*.
